# Airbus A330 VACBI CBT 34: Air Conditioning Failure Cases
 
This article will provide an overview of the air conditioning failure cases that are covered in the Airbus A330 VACBI CBT 34 module. The VACBI (Video And Computer Based Instruction) is a self-paced training tool that uses interactive animations and simulations to teach the aircraft systems and procedures. The CBT (Computer Based Training) is a web-based application that can be accessed with Microsoft Internet Explorer and requires Microsoft Runtime Animation Library.

The air conditioning failure cases that are covered in this module are:
 
- Single pack failure
- Dual pack failure
- Hot air system failure
- Trim air system failure
- Zone temperature control failure
- Cabin pressure control failure

For each failure case, the module explains the causes, effects, indications, and procedures that the crew should follow. The module also provides interactive exercises to test the learner's understanding and application of the concepts.
 
The air conditioning system is one of the most important systems on the Airbus A330, as it provides a comfortable and safe environment for the passengers and crew. It also protects the aircraft from ice formation and corrosion. Therefore, it is essential for pilots to know how to deal with any possible failures that may affect the system's performance.

In this section, we will discuss the first failure case: single pack failure. A single pack failure occurs when one of the two air conditioning packs stops working due to a mechanical or electrical fault. The pack is a device that compresses and cools the bleed air from the engines or the APU, and then distributes it to the cabin and cockpit zones. Each pack can supply enough air for the entire aircraft, so a single pack failure does not affect the air quality or quantity, but it reduces the redundancy and increases the workload of the remaining pack.
 
The causes of a single pack failure can be:

- Overheat
- Overpressure
- Valve jamming
- Controller failure
- Electrical power loss

The effects of a single pack failure are:

- The affected pack is automatically shut down and isolated.
- The PACK FAULT light on the overhead panel illuminates.
- The ECAM displays a PACK 1(2) FAULT warning message and provides the appropriate actions.
- The remaining pack operates in high flow mode to compensate for the loss of the other pack.
- The APU bleed is automatically activated if available and if the aircraft is on the ground or below 22,500 ft.
- The cabin altitude may increase slightly due to the reduced air supply.

The indications of a single pack failure are:

- The PACK 1(2) OFF light on the air conditioning panel illuminates.
- The PACK 1(2) outlet temperature on the ECAM lower display decreases.
- The PACK 1(2) flow on the ECAM lower display decreases or stops.
- The PACK 1(2) valve position on the ECAM lower display shows closed.

The procedures for a single pack failure are:

1. Confirm the PACK FAULT light and the ECAM warning message.
2. Perform the ECAM actions as follows:
    - If on ground: Start APU (if not running) and select APU BLEED ON.
    - If in flight: Select APU BLEED ON (if APU is available and aircraft is below 22,500 ft).
    - Select PACK 1(2) pb OFF.
3. Monitor the cabin altitude and temperature.
4. If necessary, use manual mode to adjust the zone temperatures.
