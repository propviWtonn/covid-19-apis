vBulletin is one of the most popular and powerful forum software that allows you to create and manage online communities. However, the official version of vBulletin requires a license fee, which may not be affordable for some users. That's why some people look for nulled versions of vBulletin, which are cracked copies that can be used for free.

However, using nulled versions of vBulletin comes with some risks, such as security vulnerabilities, malware infections, legal issues, and lack of support. Therefore, it is not recommended to use nulled versions of vBulletin on your website. If you want to use vBulletin legally and safely, you should purchase a license from the official website.
 
But if you still want to use a nulled version of vBulletin for testing purposes or personal use, you should at least install the latest security patches to fix some of the known issues. In this article, we will show you how to install vBulletin 3.8.7 Patch Level 3 Nulled PHP on your website.
 
## Step 1: Download the Patch Files
 
The first step is to download the patch files for your version of vBulletin 3. You can find them on various websites that offer nulled scripts, such as [^2^]. However, be careful when downloading files from these websites, as they may contain malware or viruses. Always scan the files with an antivirus program before opening them.
 
The patch files for vBulletin 3.8.7 Patch Level 3 Nulled PHP are named `vBulletin.v3.8.7.Patch.Level.3.PHP.NULL-DGT.zip`. You can also download them from the official vBulletin website [^1^], but you will need a valid license to access them.
 
## Step 2: Upload the Patch Files
 
The next step is to upload the patch files to your website. You can use an FTP client or a file manager to do this. You should upload all the files found within the zip file and overwrite the existing files on your server. This should not affect your modified settings or templates.
 
If you are using version 3.8.6 or before, then you should upgrade your installation of vBulletin to 3.8.9 before applying the patch [^1^]. You can download the upgrade package from the official website or from a nulled script website.
 
## Step 3: Run the Upgrade Script
 
The final step is to run the upgrade script to update your database and complete the installation of the patch. To do this, you should open your web browser and go to `http://yourdomain.com/install/upgrade.php`, where `yourdomain.com` is your website address.
