This error is caused by a faulty patch file that was distributed by some unofficial sources. The patch file is supposed to fix some graphical issues and improve performance, but it also modifies the game's executable file and causes it to crash. The official patch file from the developer does not have this problem.
 
If you have downloaded and installed the EyePatch Fixed Patch from an unofficial source, you need to uninstall it and restore the original game files. Here are the steps to do that:
 
1. Go to the folder where you installed Alan Wake and delete the file "EyePatch.dll".
2. Go to the folder where you downloaded the EyePatch Fixed Patch and delete the file "Alan.Wake.v1.05.16.5341.Update-EyePatch Fixed Patch.exe".
3. Download the official patch file from the developer's website or from a trusted source such as Steam or GOG.
4. Run the official patch file and follow the instructions to install it.
5. Launch Alan Wake and enjoy the game without any errors.
